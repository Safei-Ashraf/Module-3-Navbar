 Application of responsive Navbar, CSS and Bootstrap styling This is the solution for week 3 assignment of Front-End Dev Course @ Coursera John-Hopkins Uni. Application: Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar.

For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible.

Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window.

Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window.

Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the browser window for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text . It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content.
